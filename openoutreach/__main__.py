"""The `openoutreach` console script — one install, one wizard, one command.

The verbs, in the order a reader meets them:

    openoutreach                   # onboard if needed, then find and send: the whole thing
    openoutreach run [N]           # the same, said out loud
    openoutreach init              # onboard only — both halves, one flow
    openoutreach find 10 [emails]  # find that many more, print the campaign, exit
    openoutreach send [N|all]      # mail what is already stored
    openoutreach status [--json]   # what is configured, blocked and counted

**This is an orchestrator, not a fork.** The finding is `openoutfind`'s and the sending is
`openoutsend`'s, both installed as ordinary dependencies and both hosted here as Django
apps in one registry, on one database — see `settings.py`. `find` and `status` are the
finder's own management commands, reached with their arguments and their error contract
intact; `send` is the sender's `main()`, called in this process because the sender has no
management commands. Each child still runs standalone from its own console script, and
`outfind find --json | outsend` is still the contract they implement and test against.

**A bare invocation is `run`.** The finder alone cannot default to a verb — `find` needs a
goal number, and picking one for the operator spends their credits on a guess. `run` does
not have that problem: it is onboarding, which has nothing to guess, followed by a bounded
pass whose default goal is small and stated. So `uv tool install openoutreach &&
openoutreach` is the whole first-run command, and the overview's job — answering *what can
I do* — belongs to `openoutreach -h`.

**`run` buys addresses, and that is not a flag anyone forgot.** The finder keeps spending
opt-in because `find` is free work that a forgotten flag could quietly bill for. There is
no version of *find and then email them* that does not need an address, so `run` asks for
its goal in the `emails` unit and says so before it starts: N leads carrying an address is
at most N credits, in the same unit as the invoice.

Any command accepts `--db PATH` (or `--db=PATH`) to work against a SQLite file other than
the default `~/.openoutreach/data/db.sqlite3`; the `OPENOUTREACH_DB` env var does the same.

`manage.py` is a thin shim over this module, kept for work inside a checkout.
